# Problem Definition

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

When executing OSC DU High, a segmentation fault often occurs during memory allocation (DU_ALLOC).

**Fix:** Refer to the document on [E2AP Blockage During E2 Setup Request Build](Fix%20E2AP%20Blockage%20During%20E2%20Setup%20Request%20Build%201211009831438136b428fa8de1a96aad.md) for resolution.

**Memory Leaks:**

- **No definite memory leaks** are present (meaning no memory that is fully lost).
- **Reachable memory** might indicate that some memory remains allocated but is still referenced when the program terminates. This might be okay, as it could be global/static allocations or memory the program hasn't explicitly freed but was accessible.

### Valgrind Output Analysis

Your Valgrind report indicates no **definite** or **indirect memory leaks**, but there is a **segmentation fault** during the execution of `odu` that needs further investigation. Let's break down the report step by step:

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Heap Summary:**
    - **First run (`./du`)**:
        - **67,804 bytes** in **732 blocks** are still reachable but not freed.
        - No memory leaks (definitely or indirectly lost).
        - Valgrind suggests using `-leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all` to display reachable blocks in detail, but they are not necessarily memory leaks.
    - **Second run (`sudo ./odu`)**:
        - **151,933 bytes** in **753 blocks** still reachable.
        - Similarly, no leaks are indicated, but some memory remains reachable at the end.
2. **Memory Leaks:**
    - **No definite memory leaks** are present (meaning no memory that is fully lost).
    - **Reachable memory** might indicate that some memory remains allocated but is still referenced when the program terminates. This might be okay, as it could be global/static allocations or memory the program hasn't explicitly freed but was accessible.
3. **Segmentation Fault:**
    - The key issue is the segmentation fault:
        
        ```bash
        ./du: line 5: 213778 Segmentation fault      sudo ./odu
        
        ```
        
    - This error happens during the execution of `sudo ./odu`, not captured directly by Valgrind in terms of memory violations.
    - Valgrind doesnâ€™t report any memory errors in its memory check, so the segmentation fault might be unrelated to memory leaks but could stem from:
        - **Invalid memory access** (e.g., accessing freed memory or an out-of-bounds access).
        - **Threading issues** (e.g., race conditions).

---

### Conclusion:

- **No definite memory leaks** are shown, but **reachable memory** indicates that some allocations were not freed. These may or may not be problematic.
- The **segmentation fault** is the main issue and could be due to invalid memory access, race conditions, or another type of undefined behavior.
- To resolve the issue:
    - Use `gdb` or Valgrind to track the exact location of the segmentation fault.
    - Use AddressSanitizer (ASan) to catch potential memory corruption or out-of-bounds access.
