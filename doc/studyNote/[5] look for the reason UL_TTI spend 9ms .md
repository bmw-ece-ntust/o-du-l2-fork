ðŸ’¡ Based on the table, it can be concluded that more time was spent from PFU filling to being used by `RX_func`. (between two arrow)

ðŸ’¡ I think that the UL_TTI measurement reaching 9ms is likely due to UL_TTI notifying Layer 1 6ms in advance that the MAC PDU is being sent from the UE. This should not cause a delay issue. In actuality, the PNF takes approximately 2ms from receiving UL_TTI to filling it into the buffer, which is similar to other messages. Hence, I think there's no need to be concerned about it.
