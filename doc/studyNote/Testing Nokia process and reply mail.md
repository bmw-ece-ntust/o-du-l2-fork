Hello

Can you extract the tar file at the same place as you have extracted the previous one ?

It contains

- a modified version of the SearchSpace.c file.
- a shell script to be able to do a test taking into account the modified file.

Then type

```bash
cd RRC
./justTest.sh
```

Then you may compare with diff the files into the APER directory for the Nokia asn1c and the APER directory for the OAI or Mouse asn1c.

It should be the same.

Please send me the result.

Best regards,

Erick Bizouarn

I recently re-evaluated the script and discovered an issue that seems to stem from comparing the Nokia asn1c provided by you with another Nokia asn1c file, which inherently yields no differences. I‚Äôve since modified the script to ensure it runs with the Mouse asn1c, as intended. Please find attached the modified patch file, **MouseAsn1c.patch**, for your reference.

Following the steps you provided, I ran the test again and identified three compiled binary differences:

1. `NokiaAPER/BWP_DownlinkCommon-2.aper` and `APER/BWP_DownlinkCommon-2.aper`
2. `NokiaAPER/DownlinkConfigCommon-2.aper` and `APER/DownlinkConfigCommon-2.aper`
3. `NokiaAPER/PDCCH_ConfigCommon-3.aper` and `APER/PDCCH_ConfigCommon-3.aper`

Attached are the script execution log and the **APER** folder for further examination.
