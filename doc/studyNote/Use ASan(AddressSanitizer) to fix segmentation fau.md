### AddressSanitizer Output Analysis

The log you provided from AddressSanitizer highlights a **heap buffer overflow** during the execution of your program. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the analysis based on the error:

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Heap Buffer Overflow**:
The main issue is a **heap-buffer-overflow** in `memset`. The program is writing beyond the bounds of an allocated memory region:
    
    ```
    ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x603000000120 at pc 0x714fa5067f3d bp 0x7fffe9dfd860 sp 0x7fffe9dfd008
    WRITE of size 200 at 0x603000000120
    
    ```
    
    - The overflow happens in `__interceptor_memset`, which is part of AddressSanitizerâ€™s intercepted memory functions. It appears when calling `memset` in the function `BuildMibPdu`.
    - The address `0x603000000120` is **0 bytes beyond** the allocated 32-byte region (`[0x603000000100, 0x603000000120)`), meaning the write operation extends outside of the allocated block.
2. **Offending Functions**:
The trace shows the sequence of function calls leading to the error:
    - `BuildMibPdu` at `du_sys_info_hdl.c:190` seems to be the primary location where the buffer overflow is triggered. This is where `memset` is being used to clear or initialize a buffer.
    - The problem arises when trying to write 200 bytes to a memory region that was only allocated 32 bytes.

### **What Happened:**

The program is attempting to write more data than was allocated for the buffer. Specifically, `memset` is trying to clear or initialize 200 bytes, but the allocated buffer is only 32 bytes long. This results in writing beyond the memory boundaries and causes the **heap buffer overflow**.

### **Backtrace Breakdown**:

1. **BuildMibPdu**:
    - The first function in the trace, located in `du_sys_info_hdl.c:190`, is responsible for building the MIB PDU. The issue likely lies in this function where the memory is allocated and managed incorrectly, leading to an overflow during `memset`.
2. **asn_set_add** in `asn_SET_OF.c:27`:
    - This function handles ASN.1 encoding, and itâ€™s possible that during this process, memory is incorrectly sized or reallocated, causing the problem later in `BuildMibPdu`.
3. **BuildSib1Msg**:
    - This function is responsible for building the SIB1 message, which is closely related to MIB. The incorrect memory handling might have originated here or propagated from other parts of the system.

### **Steps to Fix**:

1. **Check Memory Allocation**:
    - In the `BuildMibPdu` function, carefully check the memory allocation for buffers. Ensure that the size of the allocated memory is sufficient for the amount of data being written by `memset`. Specifically, for any `memset` operation writing 200 bytes, ensure that at least 200 bytes have been allocated.
2. **Inspect Buffer Usage**:
    - Trace the flow of the buffer starting from allocation. Make sure the buffer is not being reused or incorrectly resized, especially in related functions like `BuildSib1Msg` or `asn_set_add`.
3. **Use Dynamic Bounds Checking**:
    - You can use AddressSanitizer with bounds checking enabled (`fsanitize=bounds`) to catch more such errors during buffer usage.
4. **Fix Overwrites**:
    - Review all buffer-handling code in the functions mentioned (`BuildMibPdu`, `BuildSib1Msg`, `asn_set_add`) and ensure the logic properly respects allocated sizes before performing any write operations.

### **Conclusion**:

The error is caused by writing beyond the allocated memory size in the `BuildMibPdu` function. Carefully check the memory allocation and ensure that the buffer is large enough for any `memset` or data write operations. By correcting the memory management in the code, you should be able to resolve this heap buffer overflow issue.
