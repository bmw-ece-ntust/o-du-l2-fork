## Motivation

Replacing the ASN.1 compiler by switching from Nokia's fork to mouse07410's fork, while reorganizing the folder structure and resolving compilation issues.

When we need to encode the SIB1 data into ASN.1 in OSC and then send it out via nFAPI, the current version of OSC fails to encode searchSpace->searchSpaceType. However, this is a required parameter. The OSC source code also mentions that this is an unresolved issue.

```c
/* Commented due to ASN decode failure in wireshark.
 * Parameters like dci_Format0_0_AndFormat1_0 which are pointer to a structure that 
 * does not have any member parameter lead to decode failure in wireshark. 
 * The issue has been reported to Nokia.
 * The following code will be uncommented once the issue is resolved */

## Problem Description

[OSC ASN.1 file status](OSC%20ASN%201%20file%20status%2012110098314380edaf54c79ad7358cca.md) 

The ASN.1 compiler (hereafter referred to as asn1c) currently used by OSC is a version forked and developed by Nokia from an open-source repository. However, multiple tests have confirmed that Nokia's developed asn1c has issues. There are two solutions to address this situation:

- Wait for Nokia's fix (OSC's recommended method)
- **Recompile using the asn1c version currently adopted by OAI (forked and developed by mouse from the same open-source repository, which is the method used in this note)**

Reference Information:

## Experimental Procedure:

To systematically propose a solution, I created a table to record all possible test combinations and their results.

Version numbers used in the environment:

---

- OAI RRC v17.3.0
- OAI F1AP ETSI TS 138 473 **V16.3.1** (2020-11)
    - 5G; NG-RAN; F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) (3GPP TS 38.473 version 16.3.1 Release 16)
- OAI E2AP  v3.01
- OAI E2SM_KPM v3.00

---

- OSC RRC v15.3
- OSC F1AP ETSI TS 138 473 **V17.3.0** (2023-01)
    - 5G; NG-RAN; F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) (3GPP TS 38.473 version 17.3.0 Release 17)
- OSC E2AP  v0300
- OSC E2SM_KPM v3.0

---

The test variables include:

- ASN.1 definition file provided by OSC
- ASN.1 definition file provided by OAI
- asn1c used by OSC (maintained by Nokia)
- asn1c used by OAI (maintained by mouse07410)

Option 2: Await Nokia's update

‚ö†Ô∏è Initially, I hypothesized that OAI's functionality might be due to its use of CMake.

After consulting with Robert about implementing CMake in OSC, I discovered that the solution was unrelated to this approach.
