Summary: Develop a mechanism to ensure that the transmission function (tx_func) does not advance excessively ahead of the reception process.

- Before the PNF socket receives TX_Data from VNF 106/0, according to the print log of tx_data->pnf_p7_slot_ind(), it has already completed execution for 106/0, and even progressed to 106/2 or 106/3, causing pnf_phy_tx_data_req to miss the chance of being called.

ðŸ‘€ I see. There is a conceptual problem in the RFsim, that it can be much faster than RX. I cannot readily tell you an answer, but maybe try to understand why tx_func is so much in advance. Then, we can think of a mechanism to not advance too much .
