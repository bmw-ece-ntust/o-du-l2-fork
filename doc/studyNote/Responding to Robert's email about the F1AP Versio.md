[Mail content](Mail%20content%20135100983143809194f9c3d7db2b4fe1.md)

### Summary of Original Description

1. **F1AP Version Issue**: Ming cannot determine the exact F1AP version used from the build logs alone and plans to follow up with further inquiries.
2. **CellGroupConfig Decoding Issue**: There is a segmentation fault in `nr_update_sr` due to a `NULL` `pucch_Config`, indicating potential initialization or memory management issues. Ming has provided the UE logs and backtrace for reference.

### Key Points in Robert‚Äôs Response

- **F1AP Version Identification**: Robert suggests checking the F1 Setup Request in the OAI output, as it should print the RRC version received from the DU if OSC O-DU-high fills it correctly.
- **CellGroupConfig Decoding Issue**: Robert confirms that `pucch_Config` being `NULL` likely causes the segmentation fault. He requests that Ming print the received `CellGroupConfig` to verify if/what the PUCCH configuration contains. Robert has provided a patch for this.

### Action Items

1. **F1AP Version Check**:
    - Verify if the F1 Setup Request message IE for the RRC version is visible in the OAI output.
    - Confirm that OSC O-DU-high is correctly filling this field.

    - Find RRC version

          </RRC-Version-ExtIEs>
      </iE-Extensions>
  </RRC-Version>
```

1. **CellGroupConfig Debugging**:
    - Apply Robert's patch to print the `CellGroupConfig` upon receipt.
    - Examine the output to identify the PUCCH configuration details and check for any initialization or memory management issues related to `pucch_Config`.
    1. **Action Items**:
        - Verify F1AP version:
            - Check the F1 Setup Request message IE for the RRC version in the OAI output.
            - Confirm that OSC O-DU-high is correctly filling this field.
            - Analyze the RRC version information found in the F1SetupResponse (11.3.0).
        - Debug CellGroupConfig:
            - Apply Robert's patch to print the `CellGroupConfig` upon receipt.

## My reply

```bash
Hi,

Following your instructions, I indeed found the version in the `F1AP-PDU F1SetupResponse`:
With OSC DU High RRC version
```
<RRC-Version>
    <latest-RRC-Version>
        000
    </latest-RRC-Version>
    <iE-Extensions>
        <RRC-Version-ExtIEs>
            <id>199</id>
            <criticality><ignore/></criticality>
            <extensionValue>
                <Latest-RRC-Version-Enhanced>11 03 00</Latest-RRC-Version-Enhanced>
            </extensionValue>
        </RRC-Version-ExtIEs>
    </iE-Extensions>
</RRC-Version>
```
With OAI VNF RRC version
```
    <RRC-Version>
      <latest-RRC-Version>
          000
      </latest-RRC-Version>
      <iE-Extensions>
          <RRC-Version-ExtIEs>
              <id>199</id>
              <criticality><ignore/></criticality>
              <extensionValue>
                  <OCTET STRING (SIZE(3))>11 03 00</OCTET STRING (SIZE(3))>
              </extensionValue>
          </RRC-Version-ExtIEs>
      </iE-Extensions>
  </RRC-Version>
```

I also compared this with the OAI CU/DU split setup, and the version number is the same.

Additionally, I applied the patch file you provided to print out the `CellGroupConfig`. I found there are quite a few differences; the content generated by the OSC DU build is significantly lacking.

By the way, Nokia mentioned they will release a fixed version of asn1c this week. My next step is to replace it with the new version to test whether SIB1 encodes/decodes successfully and to see if the current pucch_Config issue is caused by asn1c.

Best regards,

ÈäòÈ¥ª  Ming

Yes there is a big chunk missing. I think that's not right.
