# nFAPI Study Notes

Welcome to this repository! This README introduces a centralized collection of my notes related to **nFAPI** (Network Function Application Programming Interface). These notes document my studies, observations, and insights into nFAPI, particularly in the context of integrating and working with related source code.

To streamline future maintenance and collaboration, the actual source code (including **OAI** and **OSC**) has been consolidated into existing repositories under the lab's GitHub account. Each project’s code resides in specific branches of those repositories. Below, you’ll find detailed links to the source code and documentation for reference.

## Projects

### 1. OSC DU High & OAI Layer1 Integration
This section covers the integration efforts between OSC DU High and OAI Layer 1, leveraging nFAPI.

#### OAI
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/openairinterface5g.git](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/openairinterface5g.git)
    - **Branch**: [`OSC-use-nfapi`](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/openairinterface5g/tree/OSC-use-nfapi)
- **Documentation**: [https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2/tree/nFAPI/doc](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2/tree/nFAPI/doc)

#### OSC DU High
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2.git](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2.git)
    - **Branch**: [`nFAPI`](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2/tree/nFAPI)
- **Documentation**: [https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2/tree/nFAPI/doc](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/o-du-l2/tree/nFAPI/doc)

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a knowledge hub for my nFAPI-related notes. By keeping the source code in separate, well-maintained branches within the lab’s existing repositories, it becomes easier to manage updates, track changes, and collaborate with others in the future.

## How to Use
- **Notes**: Explore this repository for detailed study notes on nFAPI.
- **Source Code**: Refer to the linked repositories and branches above for the corresponding implementations.
- **Documentation**: Additional context and explanations are available in the documentation links provided.

## Integration Testing Scripts
To facilitate quick integration testing, this repository includes scripts located in the following directories:
- **NTUST-script-one-click**: Contains scripts for one-click integration testing.
- **nfapi-split-script-main**: Contains scripts for split integration testing.

These scripts are designed to streamline the testing process, making it easier to validate the integration of OSC DU High and OAI Layer 1 using nFAPI.

Feel free to dive into the notes and codebases to better understand nFAPI and its applications in these projects!
